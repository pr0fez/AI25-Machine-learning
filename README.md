# Machine learning (AI25)

This is a course with focus of learning concepts in machine learning using **scikit-learn**. This course will build upon prior skills in:

- data processing
- visualising data
- statistics
- linear algebra

The first five weeks use `sklearn` while the last three use `pytorch`.

All lecture code and exercises can be found in the course [Github repo][ghr].
