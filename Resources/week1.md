# Week 9 - Resources

## Setup 

Create a new repository on Github for this course and clone the repository

I recommend using a dedicated environment managed with `uv` for this course. From the terminal in the repo
do `uv venv`, provided you have `uv` installed.

During the first week we will revisit the housing data set and treat it numerically with machine learning techniques. We will highlight a few different techniques and then move on to _classification_ on other datasets.

## Recommended Reading 
Chapter 1-2 in [handson-mlp](https://homl.info)
> These chapters give a high-level overview of the current machine-learning landscape. We've covered most in previous courses, but it's also a preview of what the course will cover. The exercises give you opportunities to try out several advanced techniques that we will cover in detail later.

Notebook for chapter 1: [chapter1-notebook](https://github.com/ageron/handson-mlp/blob/main/01_the_machine_learning_landscape.ipynb)

During this week, we will work through Chapter 2 of the book and start Chapter 3.
